# My Fitness Journey ‚Äì Part 1  

On **April 25th**, an insurance contract nurse took my blood pressure and asked if it was normally that high: **165/93**.  

I remember thinking she was mostly worried about the top number. The bottom number didn‚Äôt seem that high to me ‚Äî after all, 80 is normal, right? I‚Äôd seen mine hover around 90 plenty of times. I always brushed it off, telling myself I could get a ‚Äúgood‚Äù reading‚Äîsomething like 120/83‚Äîif I checked enough times and caught myself in a calm moment.

This time, though, it wasn‚Äôt so easy to ignore. I was sure it was going to affect my insurance. And it did‚Äî**I was denied coverage.**

## Normal Day‚Äôs Diet  

Most mornings, my wife made **us** a **protein-and-vitamin shake**. That was our routine, something she did every day to make sure we started off right.  

Lunch was usually light, and dinner was something I typically cooked‚Äîmeat with a side of vegetables. On the surface, our daily meals were pretty balanced.  

So how did I gain the weight?

## Cheat Meals  

Honestly, it wasn‚Äôt the food we ate together. For years, I‚Äôd allowed myself a ‚Äúcheat meal‚Äù or two. Back in my running days, that meant grabbing something at Chili‚Äôs before a movie with my son, or hitting a local restaurant now and then.  

The problem was, those meals were fine when I was running and burning through the extra calories. But I wasn‚Äôt running anymore ‚Äî and I wasn‚Äôt burning anywhere near what I used to. Over time, those indulgences caught up with me.  

What started as the occasional treat eventually turned into cheat weekends.

## The Drinks  

On the surface, it didn‚Äôt seem like a couple of indulgences could undo a week of healthy eating. But the truth was in the details:  
- A few beers most nights.  
- Margaritas with those cheat meals.  
- Big restaurant portions loaded with calories.  

My body wasn‚Äôt the same as it was in my twenties or thirties, when I could get away with two margaritas, a steak smothered in mushrooms and cheese, rice, beans, chips, and salsa. Tracked honestly, that meal alone pushes **4,000+ calories**‚Äîmore than two days‚Äô worth of maintenance.

## The Wake-Up Call  

By August 16th, exactly **four months after that blood pressure check**, I‚Äôd gone from **185 lbs down to 155 lbs.**  My body fat in April was **29.3%** and now it is **13.5%**

I want to share my journey in the hopes that someone will get something from this. I do want to say that I‚Äôm still pretty deep in my journey and this is kinda a living document and may change as I change.

# Chapter One: Quitting Alcohol  

I knew alcohol was my biggest hurdle. I‚Äôd built a nightly ritual around it‚Äîbeer at home, margaritas at restaurants. So I put real thought into how I‚Äôd quit.  

- I stocked the fridge with **0% beers** (and eventually got used to them).  
- I bought ingredients for **mocktails** so I didn‚Äôt feel like I was missing out.  
- Most importantly, I stopped going to the restaurant where the staff would hand me a margarita the moment I sat down.

## The First Few Days  

Did it make a difference right away? Not exactly.  

The first few days weren‚Äôt magical. In fact, my scale showed a jump in water weight. But within a week or two, I noticed my **face looking less puffy** and my **aches and pains easing**. At first, I thought those aches were just part of turning 50.  ‚Äîbut cutting alcohol showed me otherwise.

## What I Learned About Alcohol  

I also learned some eye-opening things about alcohol:  
- It acts like a **diuretic**, pulling water from your body without actually hydrating you.  
- It slows down or **disrupts metabolism**, digestion, and other processes while your body works to clear it.  
- Sleep after drinking isn‚Äôt real recovery‚Äîit‚Äôs **shallow, poor-quality rest**.  

In other words, while I thought alcohol was helping me ‚Äúrelax,‚Äù my body was working overtime to fight off what it saw as an invader.

## The Bigger Picture  

What really surprised me was how many different ways alcohol was holding me back. It wasn‚Äôt just the calories in beer or margaritas. Alcohol also:  
- Raised my blood pressure and stressed my heart.  
- Made me crave salty, fatty foods I didn‚Äôt need.  
- Blunted hormones that help with muscle repair and fat loss.  
- Slowed recovery, making normal aches and soreness worse.  
- Increased inflammation, leaving me puffy, stiff, and older than I felt inside.  

Quitting wasn‚Äôt just about losing weight ‚Äî it gave me back **energy, recovery, clearer thinking, and better sleep**. It turned out to be the first domino that set all the others in motion.
