## Introduction

Pushups are a simple, effective bodyweight exercise that target the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core. With a small, consistent routine you can build strength and confidence without going to the gym.

## Benefits

Doing pushups regularly improves **upper-body strength**, enhances **core stability**, and increases overall functional fitness. They require no equipment and scale easily by changing variation or reps.

## What You Need

- A small patch of floor or a mat.
- A timer or phone alarm.
- Comfortable clothing.
- A short warm-up (30–60 seconds).

## Sample Routine

Follow this short, repeatable routine to build the habit and strength.

1. Warm up: 30 seconds of arm circles and wrist mobility.
2. Main set: 3 rounds of your chosen pushup variation.
3. Rest: 60–90 seconds between rounds.
4. Cool down: shoulder stretches and light mobility.

```bash
# Log your set quickly (example)
echo "$(date +%F) 3x12 standard" >> ~/pushup_log.txt
```

## Variations Table

| Variation         | Difficulty | Notes                          |
|-------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| Wall Pushup       | Easy       | Great for beginners            |
| Knee Pushup       | Moderate   | Good transition variation      |
| Standard Pushup   | Hard       | Full-body tension required     |

## Progress Approach

- Start with a version you can do with good **form** for multiple reps.
- Gradually increase reps or switch to a harder variation.
- Use short, consistent sessions rather than occasional long workouts.

### Example Weekly Plan (ordered)

1. Monday — Standard pushups, 3 sets of 8–12.
2. Wednesday — Knee or incline pushups, 4 sets of 10.
3. Friday — Pyramid session (5, 8, 12, 8, 5).
4. Optional active recovery on other days.

## Tips for Consistency

- Make **form** your top priority; quality beats quantity.
- <u>Commit to a 30-day streak</u> to embed the habit.
- Pair pushups with a trigger (after brushing teeth, before coffee).
- Track progress with a simple log to celebrate wins.

## Conclusion

Pushups are one of the most time-efficient ways to build practical strength. Be patient, prioritize form, and scale gradually to avoid injury. For habit-building strategies that pair well with this routine, see ../../content/blog/building-developer-habits.md.
